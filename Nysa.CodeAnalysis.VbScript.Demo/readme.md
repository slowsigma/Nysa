# Nysa.CodeAnalysis.VbScript.Demo

This WPF application provides a high-level demonstration of the parsing and lexing logic found in Nysa.CodeAnalysis and Nysa.CodeAnalysis.VbScript. I created these open source projects to try and convince my company that the only way to save our 20 year HTML/VB Script application was to create a translator for it. Eventually, I was given the green light to take these fundamental libraries and create the final translation application which we used to successfully translate over 2 million lines of VB Script.
