 1. Before we begin.
    This entire demo is open source.  It can be found here (show GitHub and NuGet locations).
    I'm only going to include material here that is open source. Yes, I am the author and owner of all the code and examples
    I'm going to show here. I will talk about portions of the project that were officially Tyler, but there is no code in this
    that is Tyler owned.
 2. Our story starts with the Enterprise Justice Suite, formerly called Odyssey.
    Back around the turn of the century (ha, ha), the Odyssey development team made the fateful decision to adopt
    Microsoft technology for all parts of the project and that meant coding UI logic with the now defunct VB Script language.
    Even though the dev community at large recognized JavaScript as the winner much earlier, the demise of VB Script was sealed
    in late 2018 when Microsoft announced it's intent to base it's new Edge browser on the same technology as the Chrome browser.
    Of course, we should have started turning the Titanic before that happened, but we didn't even start in 2019.
    By the time we started the turn, we had a full two decades of "investment" to fix.
    There are many ways of calculating the worth of a product like Enterprise Justice.  You can use future profit, past
    profit, or both, or you can calculate the total amount of money poured into its existence. For this demo, and my click-bait
    title, I chose calculating based on cost (i.e., how much have we sunk into this beast).
    I like to think this is more of a conservative minimum for just the cost of building the user interface alone.
    This screen is simply a little calculator, so it you wanted to, you could adjust the numbers to be more in line with the
    true average of the number of employees per year, for example.

 3. The real title of this talk is really, "Translating VB Script to JavaScript".
    If you didn't catch it from the click bait title screen we just saw, this is not a static slide presentation.
    The entire thing is a program that contains slides and interactive content that is actually using the open source
    code that the official Tyler VB Script translator was built upon.
    The basic idea of code translation is: turning code into data, and then that data back into code.

 4. We've actually been doing this since the very first high-level programming language.
<Next>
 5. Compilers read code and turn that into a string of machine code.
 6. This entire project was inspired by the Microsoft Roslyn project which I believe was created to enable all kinds of
    IDE features we take for granted today, primarily those features that allow us to jump back and forth in code
    between the definitions of symbols and the places where those symbols are used.
<Next>
 7. So, when it comes to compilers, there are some core terms that form the back bone of what this presentation covers.
    Some of these may be familiar and some may not, but by the end, you'll have a pretty good idea about how the
    translator works.
<Next>
 8. We start with source code.  I wrote this little sample script as a starting point and it will feed into different
    parts of the presentation as we go along.
<Next>
 9. Back in late 2017, I got this idea that we might be able to translate the Enterprise Justice VB Script to JavaScript
    if we first had a way to translate code into a semantic tree.  I will cover what a semantic tree is in way more
    detail later, but the basic idea is that its a direct representation of source code in computer memory in a tree
    structure (much like parsed XML in memory has a tree structure).
10. The first thing I needed was the exact grammar rules for VB Script. So, I did some online searching and was able to
    find an attempt some developers had made at writing down the rules. There were some errors in the rules, but it
    served as a good starting point.
<Next>
11. Here are those rules in a language called Backus-Naur Form (BNF). Its an extremely simple language to follow.
    Each line contains a single rule.  Each rule starts with an abstract symbol (that's the thing between greater and
    less-than characters), followed by the colon-colon-equals symbol, which stands for "is defined as", and followed
    by a set of alternate definitions separated by the vertical bar (or pipe character). Each alternate definition
    is simply a sequence of literals (the quoted strings), abstract symbols (< >), or literal categories (a name
    surrounded by curly braces).
12. Of course, the difficulty with this grammar rule language is that you don't really get to see how it works when
    you look at it raw like this. So, I've taken a little logic and turned it into an interactive page.
<Next>
13. In a BNF document for a programming language, there's always a start rule and, of course, that's the rule that
    no other rule references. So, its fitting that the start rule uses the work "program" because that's what you
    end up with at the top level.
    This little page shows how the rules expand downward as they are used in a real piece of code.
    {Work the page expanding terms...}
<Next>
14. Here's an example of that same grammar in C# code. This shows an API that I built to allow a developer to take
    grammar rules and turn that into a complete grammar object that feed into the rest of the process. Very rarely
    is a BNF document ready to be consumed by a compiler. There are instructions beyond just the BNF that a compiler
    needs.
<Next>
15. With the grammar and some additional definitions for the literal categories, we can then make a lexical analyzer
    which takes source code and turns it into a stream of tokens (each token is a single word in the language of the
    grammar).
