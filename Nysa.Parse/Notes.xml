    ------------------------ IMPORTANT ------------------------
    In previous versions of this kind of parser, I've been doing
    lexing as a separate pre-parsing step.  This simplified the
    parsing slightly but led to the consequence that a single
    string token value cannot belong to more than one category.
    
    This means that if a grammar wanted to have a specific word
    belong to multiple categories, it would have to pull the
    word out as a reserved word and then make a syntax rule
    that includes both the category and the reserved word:
    
    <SomePhrase> := "The" "carpenter" "is" "named" {Name} "."
    
    In this situation the {Name} category cannot include
    "carpenter" when using a separate lexing engine. To
    handle this situation, the grammar would need to be
    restructured as follows:
    
    <SomePrase> ::= "The "carpenter" "is" "named" <Name> "."
    <Name> ::= {GeneralNames} | "carpenter"
    
    ]]>
